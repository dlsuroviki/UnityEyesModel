This file contains links[1] to dataset generated using UnityEyes[2] - a freely available tool for rapid generation of large numbers of variable eye region images[3].

The dataset consists of 3 files in NPY format:
dataset_x_img.npy - images of synthesised eye regions (36x60x1)
dataset_x_head_angles.npy - head (camera) rotation angles (radians)
dataset_y_gaze_angles.npy - eye gaze vectors (radians)
